# [2017 608 Using Metal 2 for Compute](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/608/)

Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) provides a highly tuned library of functions that extend the power of the GPU for more than just graphics. With Metal 2, MPS comes to the Mac along with an expanded set of capabilities. Learn how to tap into the latest image processing operations, perform linear algebra operations, and accelerate machine learning algorithms via new primitives and a graph API to build and execute neural networks on the GPU.
