## Protecting Content | 2510 | p65

UIScreen.isCaptured

- Prevent capturing of audio and video content of your app
- Stop media playback or displaying sensitive content
  - Check value of `UIScreen.captured`
  - Register for `UIScreenCapturedDidChangeNotification`
  - Check `UIScreen.screens.count` to allow screen mirroring


```swift
// Protecting content of your application from being captured
import UIKit
 
class func handleScreenCapturedChange() {
    let isScreenMirroring = UIScreen.screens.count > 1
    if (UIScreen.isCaptured && !isScreenMirroring) {
        // stop audio playback and remove sensitive content from the screen
    }
    
}
```
