### Asking for Permission

- Do not prompt on first launch
- Explain why notifications are valuable
- Present at a relevant moment


## Provide value

Attention is valuable.

Send great content.

Notifications arenâ€™t reasons to launch into an app.

Considered delivery.

- x / meditation / CNN / Duolingo

Smart customization.

- Settings / ESPN / New York Times


## Notification Grouping


### Create notification threads.

```swift
// Creating groups with thread identifiers
let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
content.title = "Notifications Team"
content.body = "WWDC After Party!"
content.threadIdentifier = "notifications-team-chat"

// Yes, this is a code slide in a design presentation.
ðŸ˜Ž
```
- News app / Podcast 

Itâ€™s ok to group by app.
