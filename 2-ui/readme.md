# 2: UIKit and Cocoa Touch

Biggest single part of group 2 is about UIKit and Cocoa Touch. That is why we make it a separate directory here. 

Cocoa Touch covers not just UIKit, but also other parts of frameworks, which is specific to iOS, rather than macOS.


iOS 7 (2013) is a biggest upgrade, on both iOS user experience and UIKit. So we choose to include all past sessions since that year. Pre-iOS 7 was also valuable, but not yet top proirity for our effort and your reading.
